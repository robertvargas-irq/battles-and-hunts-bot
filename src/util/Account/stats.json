        "**How fast you react or run.**\nWindclan used to be known for this, but The Unforgiven seem to have followed their footsteps…",
        "**How smart you are.**\nYou can make plans and think things through. The Unforgiven's hierarchy is well thought put, and their battle prowess intimidates the clans!",
        "**Persuasiveness, Likability, how you present yourself.**\nHow will you convince anyone if you can't even convince yourself? Thunderclan is full charismatic and well liked cats!",
        "**How well you swim.**",
